Compatibility
------------

This version of this component is fully functional with Apache ManifoldCF 1.6 and
above and with Elasticsearch 1.5.2.

Upgrading
---------
If you are replacing a version of Apache ManifoldCF Plugin for ElasticSearch that is
older than version 2.0, you must declare two additional fields (representing parent
acls and parent deny acls), and reindex all your documents.  Otherwise, the plugin
will prevent you from viewing any documents.

Instructions for Building Apache ManifoldCF Plugin for Elastic Search from Source
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download the Java SE 6 JDK (Java Development Kit), or greater, from
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html.
   You will need the JDK installed, and the %JAVA_HOME%\bin directory included
   on your command path.  To test this, issue a "java -version" command from your
   shell and verify that the Java version is 1.6 or greater.

2. Download and install Maven 2.2.1 or later.  Maven installation and configuration
   instructions can be found here:

http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html

3. Build packages

Execute the following command in order to build the JAR packages and install 
them to the local repository:

mvn install

The JAR packages can be found in the target folder:

target/elasticsearch-plugin-mcf-<VERSION>.jar

... where <VERSION> is the release version

4. Building distribution assemblies 

Execute the following command in order to build the distribution assemblies

mvn package assembly:assembly

5. Fix EOL in source files

Fix the archive files so the source files have the correct EOL settings:

mvn antrun:run

Usage
